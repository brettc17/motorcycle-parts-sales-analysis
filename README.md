# Motorcycle Parts Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data for a company that sells motorcycle parts. The company operates three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. The goal is to gain insights into wholesale revenue by product line, how it varies month-to-month, and across warehouses.

## Dataset
The dataset provided contains the following fields:
- `order_number`: Unique order number
- `date`: Date of the order (June to August 2021)

- `client_type`: Whether the order was Retail or Wholesale
- `product_line`: Type of product ordered
- `quantity`: Number of products ordered
- `unit_price`: Price per product (in dollars)
- `total`: Total price of the order (in dollars)
- `payment`: Payment method (Credit card, Transfer, or Cash)
- `payment_fee`: Percentage of total charged as a result of the payment method

## Project Instructions
The task is to calculate net revenue for each product line, grouped by month and warehouse, for Wholesale orders. The net revenue is calculated as the sum of total minus the sum of payment_fee.

## SQL Query
A SQL query has been written to achieve the required analysis. The query calculates net revenue for each product line, month, and warehouse, and sorts the results accordingly.

## Repository Structure
- `sales_data.csv`: CSV file containing the sales data
- `sales_analysis.sql`: SQL query for analyzing sales data
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Load the sales data from `sales_data.csv` into your SQL database.
2. Execute the SQL query provided in `sales_analysis.sql`.
3. Review the results to gain insights into wholesale revenue by product line, month, and warehouse.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the wholesale revenue generated by product line, month, and warehouse for a company selling motorcycle parts. The analysis can be used to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, sales strategies, and warehouse operations.
